## About

I've decided to remake my first [project](https://cardosojse.github.io/old-fakedex) to discover how much I got better at coding.
The area that I most learned and made progress was on how manipulate data structure. And the design got a lot better too!

## How to access

You can [access my project](https://cardosojse.github.io/fakedex) or [clone](https://github.com/cardosojse/fakedex) thru GitHub.
